SECTION B	SHORT QUESTIONS
1-

1) Normalization; when the data is split in multiple tables connected through keys (also it follows some properties) the
process is called as normalization, as in the given schema the data is stored in multiple tables and related through keys.

   Denormalization; keeping all the data in one table.

2) The normalized database has levels like 1NF, 2NF, etc.

   No levels for denormalization.

3) The normalization is better to perform when you are inserting, updating and deleting database. Also it helps to create
   efficient database with no dublicates and minimizes null values.
   
   The denormalization is better when you need to retrieve data. otherwise use joins and subqueries. result in slower
   retreival.

2-

1) Views; It is used to simplify complex query. The Views also remains after session expires.

2) Temp Tables; It is used to create temporary table with specific data for fast execution of queries. I expires or 
   deletes when the session expires (local) or all session closes (global).

3) Indexing; It is used to index column or group of columns for faster access (due to indexing). The indexing can also
   be performed in a base table.

3-

a) Primary key: StudentID, departments.DepartmentID

b) Foreign Key: Students.DepartmentID.

c) Candidate Key: StudentID, RollNumber, CNIC, Email, DepartmentID.

d) Super Key: StudentID, RollNumber, CNIC, Email, DepartmentID, (StudentID, any_column), (RollNumber, any_column),
             (CNIC, any_column), (Email, any_column), (RollNumber, any_column), (Departments.DepartmentID, DepartmentName),
	     etc.

e) Surrogate Key: StudentID.

f) Unique Key: StudentID, RollNumber, CNIC, Email, Departments.DepartmentID.
